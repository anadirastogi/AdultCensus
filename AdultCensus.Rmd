## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

##Clear workspace
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

##Libraries and packages
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
```

##Read file and view data

We read the file into R and look at the data to get a sense of what we are working with.
```{r}
mydata<-read.csv(file = "adult.csv")
head(mydata)
```

##Save dataset in tidy way 
```{r}
mydata<-as_tibble(mydata)
```

##Check for null values and count the number of null values

Since there are a number of records in our data that contain "?" we first need to let R know that these are missing values
```{r}
## set ? = NA
mydata$workclass[mydata$workclass == "?"] <- NA
mydata$occupation[mydata$occupation == "?"] <- NA
mydata$native.country[mydata$native.country == "?"] <- NA

## Count number of missing values
 
sum(is.na(mydata))

## we have 4262 missing values in our dataset
```
## Remove missing values
```{r}
clean<-na.omit(mydata)
```
```{r}
View(clean)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
